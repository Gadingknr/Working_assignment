	<p>It can be very daunting looking at a page full of code, especially</p>
  <p>If it is a new language to learn. Even though CSS and HTML was not</p>
  <p>my first programming language to learn, it was actually quite a challenge</p>
  <p>to learn. However, as time goes by, it is getting easier to understand the </p>
  <p>language. Michael has done an amazing job explaining the material</p>
  <p>to make it easy to understand.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The very first thing that I can learn from making this website is</p>
  <p>I need to manage my time a lot better, but this semester has not been</p>
  <p>very easy for me, one of the units that I need to take is the business </p>
  <p>internship and it took so much time from my studies and on top of that</p>
  <p>I still need to work. However, I am not too disappointed with the folio</p>
  <p>I made. It might be very simple but it is a very strong start to my web</p>
  <p>developer journey. The hardest thing for me to understand is the semantic tags</p>
  <p>that I need to use instead of Div, a lot of tutorials on YouTube and W3Schools are </p>
  <p>using div tags, however, in the lecture, it is mentioned that it is not the best</p>
  <p>practice anymore. Even though there are some features that is missing,</p>
  <p>overall I am happy with the outcome of the outcome of the folio.</p>
